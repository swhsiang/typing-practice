# Dinosaur

Dinosaurs are diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared
during the Triassic period.. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the
subject of active research, current sitific consesus places their origin between 231 and 243 million
years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassuc extinction event
201 million years ago.Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended
when the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 years ago.

Until the late 20th century, all groups of dinosaurs were belived to be extinct. The fossil  record,
however, indicates that birds, which are now termed "avian dinosaurs", are the modern descendants of\
feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from theropod ancestors during the Jurassic Period. As such,
birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the mass extinction event.

Throughout the remainder of this article, the term "dinosaur" is sometimes used generically to refer
to the combined grooup of avian dinosaurs (birds) and non-avian dinosaurs, while at other times
it is used to refer to the non-avian dinosaurs specifically, while the avian dinosaurs are sometimes
simply referred to as "birds". This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs are varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints.
Birds, at over 10,000 livign species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish.
Using fossil evidence, palontologists have identified over 500 ditinct genera and more thant 1,000
different species of non-avian dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species and fossil remains. Some are
herbivorous, others carnivorous. While dinosayrs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included
quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such
as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal
modifications such as bony armor and spines. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are
additional trits ahred by all dinosaur.

While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of
flight, many prehistoric dinosaur (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied-the largest sauropod dinosaurs are
estimated to have teched lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 meters (59 feet) and were the
largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea thatnon-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a
misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy boned are more likely to last until they
are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: Xixianykus, for example, was only about 50 cm (20 in) long.

Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted
fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums  around the world, and dinosaurs have become
an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous
and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as
Jurassic Park. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur
science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.

## Etymology

The taxon Dinosauria was formally named in 1842 by paleontologist Sir Richard Owen, who used it to refer to the "distinct tribe or
sub-order of Saurian Reptiles" that were then being recognized in England and around the world. The tern is derived from the Greek
words (sauros, meaning "lizard" or "reptile"). Though the taxonomic named has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs'
teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.

Although the word dinosaur literally means "terrible lizard", the name is something of an etymological misnomer; even though dinosaurs
are reptiles, they are not lizards, nor are they descended from them. Instead, dinosaurs, like many extinct forms of reptile sub-groups,
did not exhibit characteristics which were traditionally regarded as reptilian, such as a sprawling limb posture or ectothermy
(colloquially referred to as "cold-bloodedness"). Additionally, many other prehistoric animals, including mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs,
pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and Dimetrodon, while oftern popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.

## Definition

Under phylogenetic nomenclature, dinosaurs are usuall defined as the group consisting of Triceratops, Neornithes [modern birds], their
most recent common ancestor (MRCA). and all descendants. It hs also been suggested that Dinosauria be degined with respect of the MRCA
of  Megalosaurus and Lguanodon, because these were two of the three genera cited by Ricard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria. Both
definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs. "Dinosauria = Ornithischia + Saurischia", encompassing
ankylosaurians (armored herbiborous quadrupeds), stegosaurians (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), ceratopsians (herbivorous quadrupeds with
horns and frills), ornithopods (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including "duck-bills"), theropods (mostly bipedal caenivores and birds),
and sauropodomorphs (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with logn neks and tails).
