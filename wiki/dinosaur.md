# Dinosaur

Dinosaurs are diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared
during the Triassic period.. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the
subject of active research, current sitific consesus places their origin between 231 and 243 million
years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic-Jurassuc extinction event
201 million years ago.Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended
when the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 years ago.

Until the late 20th century, all groups of dinosaurs were belived to be extinct. The fossil  record,
however, indicates that birds, which are now termed "avian dinosaurs", are the modern descendants of\
feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from theropod ancestors during the Jurassic Period. As such,
birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the mass extinction event.

Throughout the remainder of this article, the term "dinosaur" is sometimes used generically to refer
to the combined grooup of avian dinosaurs (birds) and non-avian dinosaurs, while at other times
it is used to refer to the non-avian dinosaurs specifically, while the avian dinosaurs are sometimes
simply referred to as "birds". This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs are varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints.
Birds, at over 10,000 livign species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish.
Using fossil evidence, palontologists have identified over 500 ditinct genera and more thant 1,000
different species of non-avian dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species and fossil remains. Some are
herbivorous, others carnivorous. While dinosayrs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included
quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such
as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal
modifications such as bony armor and spines. Evidence suggests that egg laying and nest building are
additional trits ahred by all dinosaur.
