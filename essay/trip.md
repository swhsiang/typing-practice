This August I had a trip to visit Silicon Valley in the west California, United States. Silicon Valley is a big area nearby the bay.
I stayed in the west bay and south bay during this trip. I enjoyed my a good time there.

People in Silicon Valley are nice. I went to the local programmer meetup and made a lot of friends. They shared
experiences of programming and stories of startup to me. Some of them invited me to visit their company or have an 
interview with their boss. Therefore, I got a job offer in the end of this trip.

Culture in Silicon Valley is inspiring. A lot of great technology companies locate at there, like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn.
People in there are working on their dreams. They have some ideas or expectations of future life. Working hard to make their
dream come true. Sometimes, they may fail. They accept failures and start to taking on other challenges. During this
trip, I met a lot of entrepreneurs and they shared their stories. That are inspiring.

Cuisine in Silicon Valley is awesome. A lot of immigrants living there and there are many restaurants with different styles.
For example, Poke Bar is a famous restaurant in Mountain View city. It is a new style of Japanese food. It looks like a box
of salad with fish meat and vegetables. The taste is good.

Transport system in Silicon Valley needs to be improved. There are a rail way, called Caltrain, and two high ways, 101 and 280.
People can take the Caltrain to visit south bay from the north bay. Trains run every hour. The traffic in the high way is bad.
Basically, there is a traffic jam in the high way 101 and 280 every morning and evening. People spend at least two hours in the
car in the traffic jam everyday. That is why big technology companies in Silicon Valley, like Google, Tesela, and Uber,
focus on self driving car. The founders and investors in Silicon Valley believe self driving car is the solution of traffic jam.

I had a good time and great memory in the Silicon Valley. I learned a lot from people in there and tasted many delicious food.
Hope to visit there soon.
